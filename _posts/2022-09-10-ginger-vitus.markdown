Shout out to Uncle Barry's in Park Slope for this delightfully punny drink. I hope I didn't butcher it.<br/>
<br/>
## What you need:
* 2 parts Pimm's
* 2 parts lemon juice
* 1 part ginger syrup
* 1 part cucumber vodka
* Club soda
* Ice
<br/>
<br/>

## Do This:
* Pour everything except the club soda into a cocktail shaker with ice
* Shake (the cocktail shaker, not you) until the outside of the shaker feels cold
* Serve over ice and topped with club soda
* Drink responsibly.
