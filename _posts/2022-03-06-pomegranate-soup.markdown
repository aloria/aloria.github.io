I brought this to Christmas dinner with my soon-to-be in-laws. They pretended to like it.<br/>

## What you need
* 32 ounces of pomegranate juice
* 2 tbsp lemon juice
* Some sort of neutral cooking oil. I used sunflower.
* 1 medium yellow onion, diced
* a bunch of garlic cloves, minced
* .5 cup split peas
* .5 cup lentils
* .5 cup mung beans
* .5 cup barley
* Beets, diced into small chunks -- about 2 cups
* 2 tsp dried mint. If you cant find this, get fresh mint. Wrap it in a bunch of paper towels with a silica gel packet (aka "the danger salt.") You will have dried mint after a day or so.
* 2 tsp cumin
* 2 tsp tumeric
* 2 cups white cooking wine or dry white wine
* 10 cups of water or stock. I used water and vegetable "Better than Bullion"<br/><br/>

For toppings:
* pomegranate arils
* sour cream or thick yogurt <br/>
<br/>

## Do this
* Get a saucepan and bring the pomegranate and lemon juice to a boil
* Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the pomegranate juice becomes thick; this takes a little under two hours.
* In a large pot or instant pot, add enough oil to coat the bottom. On medium-high heat, sweat the onions for about 5 minutes
* Add the garlic and cook for another couple minutes until fragrant
* Add the stock, wine, all of the spices except the mint, and the beans, peas, lentils, and barley
* If using an instant pot, pressure cook on high for 15 minutes. If not, bring soup to a boil, then reduce temperature to medium-low and simmer for 1.5 hours or until the mung beans are tender
* Add the mint and .5 cup of the reduced pomegranate juice
* Add MSG (or salt if you're basic) and black pepper to taste, making sure to simmer for a few minutes before adding more
* Top the soup with sour cream or yogurt. You could throw in some cilantro if you're feeling fancy.
* Eat the soup.
