## What you need
* Bacon
* Dark Chocolate
* Powdered sugar
* Peanut or other oil with a high smoke point
* 1 egg
* 1 cup buttermilk
* (optional) 1 tbsp some sort of hot sauce
* 1 cup flour
* .5 tsp black pepper
* .25 tsp baking soda
* .25 tsp baking powder
<br/>
<br/>



## Do this
* Fry bacon to desired crispiness. Pat grease off bacon with paper towels and let cool. Reserve bacon fat in pan for later frying
* Mix dry ingredients (except sugar and chocolate, duh) together in a bowl
* Mix buttermilk, egg, and hot sauce together in a separate bowl
* Re-heat bacon fat and enough additional oil to cover the bottom of the pan on medium high heat
* Dunk bacon slices in flour mixture. Dunk into the egg mixture. Dunk again in the flour mixture
* Fry briefly on both sides until coating is golden brown
* Pat grease off and let cool again
* Melt dark chocolate. You can use a double boiler or microwave in very short bursts.
* Dip fried bacon into chocolate or drizzle chocolate over. You do you.
* Once chocolate has set, dust with powdered sugar if so desired
* Embrace your newly hardened arteries <br/>
