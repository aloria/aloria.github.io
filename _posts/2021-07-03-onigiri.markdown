## What you need
* Sushi rice
* Nori (seaweed sheets, not the snack food)
* Some sort of filling. I like takana, but you can use sushi grade raw fish, canned tuna, etc.
* (Optional) Furikake. If you can't find it locally, there are many varieties on Amazon
<br/>
<br/>



## Do this
* Cook your rice. If you have an instant pot, you can use my [How to Cook Grains in an Instant Pot](https://just-the.recipes/2020/11/06/grains) recipe
* Let the rice cool enough so you don't burn your hands touching it
* Spinkle in the furikake if you're using it, and mix in with your hands
* Wet your hands and rub a bit of salt between them
* Grab a fistful sized amount of rice and form into a ball
* Squash the ball flat and press a divot in the center
* Place your fillings in the divot
* Fold rice over the fillings and form into a triangle
* Wrap your rice triangle in the nori. I prefer wrapping the whole thing, but you can do the landing strip: üçô
