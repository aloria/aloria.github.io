## What you need
* Medium saucepan
* Whisk
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1 clove of garlic, diced, pressed or smooshed.
* 2 tbsp flour
* salt & pepper, to taste
* 1 cup milk
* 1 cup of deli sliced ham, cut into strips or squares
* 2 slices of bread, toasted


## Do this
1. Melt the butter in a saucepan.
2. Put garlic in and cook until fragrant, only a minute or two.
3. Sprinkle in flour, salt and pepper, whisk until it forms a paste.
4. Stir in milk, whisking constantly.
5. Cook over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens a little, still whisking constantly.
6. Remove from heat. Add ham to the sauce and heat through.
7. Serve over toast.

You may prefer more meat, or less meat depending on how much sauce you have. YMMV.
