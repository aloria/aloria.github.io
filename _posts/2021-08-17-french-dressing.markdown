Another hit by [Midnight Rambler](https://twitter.com/mramblr).

## What you need
* 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
* balsamic vinegar to bring up to 1/3 cup
* 1 1/2 tsp salt
* ground black pepper
* 1 tsp Dijon mustard
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed
* tiny pinch sugar

## Do this
* Mix together in order, making sure the salt is completely dissolved before adding the mustard.

Add:
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 1/2 cup canola, grapeseed, or other vegetable oil*
* Blend with a hand blender so itâ€™s smooth and emulsified.<br/><br/>

If the proportions are right, it should hardly separate at all even after days. Add a little more oil if needed to get the flavor balance right (after trying it on salad).
