Please don't make this and record yourself doing a mukbang. We've had enough of those already.
<br/>
<br/>

## What you need
* 1 package ramen or soba noodles. You can use thin spaghetti in a pinch.
* 2 tbsp peanut or coconut oil
* A bunch of scallions. Use however much you want. Go nuts.
* 5-6 cloves of garlic
* 2 tbsp grated ginger or .5 tsp garlic powder
* 4 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp mirin, sake, or marsala
* 1 tbsp rice vinegar
* 2 tbsp sesame oil
* 2 tbsp chili paste (I use Huy Fong Chili Garlic Sauce)

## Do this
* Cook the noodles according to the package directions. Omit the flavor packet. Or don't. I'm not your mom.
* Drain the noodles and set aside
* Chop the scallions, keeping the white and green parts separate
* In some sort of skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat
* Add the white scallions, garlic, and ginger and stir for a minute or two
* Add soy sauce, vinegar, mirin/ wine, chili paste, and sesame oil and stir for another minute
* Add your noodles and stir to combine with the sauce
* Serve topped with green scallions

<br/>
You can add some sort of protein like tofu or chicken, but I'll leave that up to you.
