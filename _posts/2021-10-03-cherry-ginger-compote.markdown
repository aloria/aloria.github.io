## Do This:
* The night before, put the dried cherries in a heat safe container
* Mix the ginger powder into one cup of boiling water
* Pour the ginger water over the cherries, making sure they are all covered
* Cover the container and refrigerate overnight
* The next day, drain the liquid from the cherries
* Add the cherries to a small saucepot and stir in the chopped ginger
* In a small pot, simmer the cherry-ginger mixture on low heat for about (?) 15-30 minutes
* Add the lemon juice, and flaxseed to the mixture and stir
* Bring to a boil and cook for about 4 minutes. Taste periodically to add more ginger to your taste. Don't burn yourself.
* If the mixture is too runny for your liking, add more flax a teaspoon at a time while it simmers 
* Let cool enough to put back in the blender/ processor and pulverize to your desired level of chunkiness
* Put in some sort of container like a used jam jar. Or a mason jar with a little bit of twine wrapped around it, you filthy hipster.<br/><br/>
