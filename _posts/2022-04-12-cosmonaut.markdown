## What you need:
* 4 oz Russian vodka. I prefer ВОЗДУХ but Stoli is good, too.
* 2 tbsp Tang powder
* Ice
* (optional) An orange slice
<br/>
<br/>

## Do This:
* Stir the the Tang powder into the vodka until dissolved
* Shake Tang + vodka mixture in a cocktail shaker with ice until the outside of the shaker feels cold
* Pour it into some kind of glass. Garnish with the orange slice if you're feeling fancy
* За здоровье.
