Probably should have posted this before Thanksgiving. I never said I was competent.<br/>
<br/>

## What you need
* 1 lb slab turkey tenderloin or breast
* Olive oil
* 1 cup carrots, sliced
* 1 medium yellow onion, sliced
* 1 red bell pepper, cut into strips
* .5 cup chicken broth
* .5 cup marsala
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* .25 tsp rosemary
* .5 tsp black pepper
* .5 tsp THE FLAVA ENHANCA (MSG)
* .5 tbsp dried parsley


## Do this
* The night before cooking, mix broth, marsala, and spices (except parsley) in a container and plop your turkey in there. Refrigerate, flipping the turkey over periodically if the liquid does not cover it entirely
* Preheat oven to 400 °F
* Line a baking dish with aluminum foil. Drizzle olive oil over foil, then add vegetables
* Place turkey on top of vegetables and pour marinade over everything
* Sprinkle with parsley
* Cook for ~45 minutes, until turkey reaches internal temperature of 160 °F
* Turn broiler on high and brown for ~5 minutes<br/>
<br/>
Serve with the usual sides. I personally require cranberry sauce. If you serve me turkey without cranberry sauce, I will set fire to your kitchen.<br/>
