## What you need
* 1 lb boneless whitefish, like cod or tilapia or something
* 2 cups mashed potatoes
* 1 egg
* 1 cup breadcrumbs
* .25 cup flour
* .25 tsp black pepper
* .5 tsp garlic powder
* .25 tsp chili powder

## Do this
* Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a skillet on medium heat and cook fish until flaky
* In a bowl, break fish into flakes
* Add mashed potatoes, egg, green onion, and spices and mix
* Gradually add breakcrumbs and mix until mixture holds shape into a ball
* Form mixture into balls. Squish balls flat
* Coat both sides of each fish cake in flour and transfer to the fridge for about 20 minutes
* Heat rest of oil in skillet on medium heat and cook fish cakes until golden brown on each side<br/>

You can put tartar sauce on these, but I think that's nasty.<br/>
