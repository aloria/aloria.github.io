## What you need:
* 2 oz London dry style gin (I like Hendrick's Midsummer Solstice)
* 0.5 oz lemon juice
* 0.5 oz simple syrup
* 2-3 oz Brut Champagne (or other sparkling wine)
* Lemon twist
* Ice
* A cocktail shaker
<br/>
<br/>

## Do This:
* Put gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup in a cocktail shaker
* Fill shaker with ice
* Cover and shake the heck out of it until the outside of the shaker is cold
* Strain into a champagne glass. Or drink it out of a Solo cup; I don't judge.
* Top with champagne
* Garnish with lemon twist
* Drink responsibly.
