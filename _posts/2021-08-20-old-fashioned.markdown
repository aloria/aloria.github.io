I just turned 39. Is that too young to be old fashioned? hyuk yuk yuk.
<br/>
<br/>

## What you need:
* Some sort of fire producing apparatus, like a lighter or one of those fancy kitchen blowtorches
* A big chonky ice cube
* 1 tsp sugar
* 2 oz rye or bourbon. I prefer bourbon because I like my throat to hurt.
* 2 dashes orange bitters, or Angostura bitters if that's what you have
* 1 tsp water
* A rocks glass
* 2 slices of orange peel
<br/>
<br/>

## Do This:
* Add sugar, bitters, and water to the rocks glass and stir until sugar is mostly dissolved
* Add the chonky ice cube
* Add the booze and stir gently. It's had a long day too, you know.
* Bend a slice of orange peel so the oils come out and rub on the rim of the glass
* With your fire maker lit, bend the second slice and bring close to the flame to ignite the ccocktails
* Drop the second slice in the glass
* Drink responsibly.
