It's a fern you can eat. Very popular in Maine.
<br/>
<br/>

## What you need
* ~1 lb fiddleheads
* Minced or crushed garlic. I use 3 cloves, but go nuts
* 3 tbsp butter
* 2 tbsp lemon juice
* THE FLAVA ENHANCA (MSG) or salt
* Black pepper (to taste)

<br/>
<br/>



## Do this
* Clean the fiddleheads by rinsing with cold water. Remove any brown stuff and snip the ends
* Bring a pot of salted/ MSGed water to a boil and cook the fiddleheads for 5 minutes
* Remove the fiddleheads from the water and pat dry with paper towels so you don't get spattered with hot butter in the next step
* Melt butter over medium high heat. Add the fiddleheads and saut√©e for ~5 minutes, until they start to brown
* Add the garlic, lemon juice and pepper and cook for another 3 minutes

I don't know if Stephen King likes fiddleheads, but I am going to assume he does.
