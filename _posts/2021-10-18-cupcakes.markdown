## What you need
For the batter:

* 1 cup sweet potato puree (I used canned because I am lazy)
* 0.5 cup honey
* 2/3 cup vegetable oil
* 2 large eggs
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 1/3 cups all purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1.5 tsp baking soda
* 2.5 tsp Chinese 5 spice
* .5 tsp salt
* A cupcake tin (I use a silicone one but get those paper cups if yours is metal)<br/><br/>

If you're feeding this to a a dog make sure to check its ingredients. For example, nutmeg is toxic to dogs.

For the frosting:

* .5 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
* (optional) 1 tbsp flaxseed oil. It's good for you or something.
* 4 oz cream cheese, room temperature
* 1 cups powdered sugar
* 2 tsps vanilla
* .5 tsp salt

## Do this
* Preheat oven to 350Â°F
* Mix the wet batter ingredients together
* Gradually mix the dry batter ingredients into the wet stuff
* Pour batter into cups
* Bake for 15 minutes then cool
* While cupcakes are baking, mix together frosting ingredients
* Frost cupcakes
* Eat cupcakes
