## What you need
For the cupcakes:
* 1.5 cups flour
* .5 cups sugar
* .5 cup oil
* 2 eggs
* .5 cup coffee, cooled
* 1/3 cup baking cocoa
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp peppermint extract
* cupcake cups
* (optional) 1 tbsp ground flaxseed<br/>
<br/>

For the icing:
* 1 candy cane or a bunch of peppermint candies, crushed
* 1 stick butter, softened
* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 2 tsp cooled coffee
* .25 tsp peppermint extract


## Do this
* Preheat oven to 350 Â°F
* Line a muffin tin with those weird cupcake cups
* Mix dry ingredients together
* In a separate bowl, mix wet ingredients together and add to dry ingredients. Or just dump everything in a stand mixer like my lazy ass does
* Fill each cupcake cup with batter to about 75% full
* Bake for ~15 minutes, until a toothpick in the center of a cupcake comes out clean
* While cooling, work on the frosting. Just mix all those frosting ingredients together except for the crushed candy.
* Frost cooled cupcakes and sprinkle with crushed candy <br/>
