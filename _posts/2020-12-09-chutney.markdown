When you like to add something to feel pain.<br/>
<br/>

## What you need
* 50-150 g of fresh chilies (depending on level of SHU/doom you think is right for you)
* 150 g medium size cherry tomatoes
* 1 tbsp coriander seeds
* 1 tbsp fenugreek
* 1 tbsp mustard seeds
* 1 tbsp fennel seeds
* 1 tbsp cumin
* ½ dl oil (not too acidic)
* 1-2 tbsp grated fresh ginger
* a bit of salt
* ½ dl apple cider vinegar
* 4 tbsp brown sugar (or more...)

## Do this
* CRUSH THE SPICES!
* Chop chilies and tomatoes to a reasonable size.
* Mix everything but vinegar and sugar in a pot over highest heat setting and immediately turn it down - stir, but do not splash it everywhere.
* After 10 minutes where the contents have been having fun, while you have been exciting it to keep it from burning, add the sugar.
* Stir for a few minutes and observe that everything is now brownish.
* If the amount of liquids have reduced, so the contents are more stew than soup, add the vinegar.
* Get the pot bubbling while stirring.
* Set the pot at a low enough burn that it still bubbles, stir when needed.
* Prepare preserving jars, scalding water is hot, so try not to burn yourself - or others.
* When the contents are as thick as prepared grits, put it in jars.
* There will be a bit remaining in the pot... Have a bit of bread ready to try it out.
* Add this to rice dishes or to bread with cheese or whatever you want.<br/>
