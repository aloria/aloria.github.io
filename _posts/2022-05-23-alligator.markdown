IN SOVIET RUSSIA, GATOR BITES... yeah nope<br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* 1 lb alligator tenderloins
* Whole milk (~2 cups)
* 1 16oz Italian dressing
* .25 cup lemon juice
* .25 cup white wine or cooking sherry
* High heat oil (I used grapeseed)
* 1 tbsp butter
* 2 tbsp Mike's Hot Honey
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* To taste:
  * Black pepper
  * Red chili flakes
  * THE FLAVA ENHANCA (MSG)

## Do this
* PREP THE GATOR
  * Overnight, soak the tenderloins in enough milk to cover
  * At least 3 hours before cooking, drain the milk from the tenderloins and marinade in lemon juice and Italian dressing
* COOK THE GATOR
  * Remove tenderloins from marinade and blot dry
  * On high heat, heat enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of a frying pan
  * Cook the tenderloins on each side for about 3 minutes each, until they reach an internal temperature of 160 Â°F and is seared on both sides, seasoning with MSG and black pepper
  * Remove tenderloins and set aside
  * Reduce heat to medium; deglaze the pan with wine, making sure to scrape up the black bits
  * Add butter, hot honey, chili flakes and soy sauce and cook until thickened
* EAT THE GATOR
  * Serve with some sort of side (I picked rice) and top with sauce
