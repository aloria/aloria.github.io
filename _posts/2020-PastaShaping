pasta is like edible clay dough <br/>
<br/>
## What you need
  * Flour
  * Water
  * Oil and Eggs
  * Oatmeal

## Read all instructions first, then decide if it make sense 
* Mix dry ingredients 
  *Use 100% all purpose flour and later try blends of flour semolina, whole wheat, almond, 
* Slowly add wet ingredients until a dry crumbly texture appears
* Goal force dry ingredients to absorb wet ingredients by mechanical force
* Effective mechanical force is hand squishing and palm pressing, like CPR on the pasta
* chances are the dough is too wet and needs flour or to dry and needs water
* make adjustments until you can pinch off dough that doesnt stick to your hand
* Pinch off a small piece of dough and flatten or press dough against solid textures to shape it
* imagine fun shapes to eat or plate, try to post photos if you try
* adding food color can make this activity more colorful, before the dough is a ball
* Boil the pasta until it floats, it cooks fast.
* Shaping pasta one piece at a time is worth hours of fun
