pasta is like edible clay dough <br/>
<br/>
## What you need
  * Flour
  * Water
  * Oil and Eggs
  * Oatmeal

## Do this
* Mix dry ingredients 
  *Use 100% all purpose flour and later try blends of flour semolina, whole wheat, almond, 
* Slowly add wet ingredients until a dry crumbly texture appears
* add small amounts of water until dough forms a ball:
* if its too sticky slowly add more flour
* Dough is now ready for shaping
* Pinch off a small piece of dough and flatten or press dough against solid textures to shape it
* Boil the pasta until it floats, it cooks fast.
* Shaping pasta one piece at a time is worth hours of fun
