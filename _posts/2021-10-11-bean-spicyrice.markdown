Here's how you make one of my favourite dishes. <br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* Rice
* Celery
* Onion
* Sriracha
* Salsa Verde
* Ground Sage
* Northern Beans
* Nutritional Yeast
* Garbanzo Beans
* Vegetable Bullion
* Black Pepper & Salt

## Do this
* Cook (2/4th Cup) Northern Beans & (1/4th Cup) Garbanzo Beans 5 minutes on high. Turn off burner & let soak for 1 hour. Then cook beans 5 minutes on high & then simmer for 1 hour or until tender.
* Once beans are cooked, put 2/4th cup of rice in with the beans & cook until the rice is al-dente.
* Chop Onions & brown in a pan. After browned put onions in with beans & rice.
