The first time I ever got drunk was when I was 16 and took a trip to Spain. My friends didn't like the sangria so I drank the entire pitcher and ended up calling them "putas baratas" whenever I needed to translate for them. <br/>

## What you need:
* A bottle of dry red wine
* .5 cup brandy
* An apple
* An orange
* 4 tbsp symple syrup
* 1 cup orange juice
* Ice
<br/>
<br/>

## Do This:
* Cut the apple into wedges
* Cut the orange into round slices
* Dump everything in a pitcher and stir
* Drink responsibly and do not attempt to speak Spanish to underpaid gift shop owners.
