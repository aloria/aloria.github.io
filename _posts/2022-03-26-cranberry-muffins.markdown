Muffins are just cupcakes that are socially acceptable to eat for breakfast.<br/>

## What you need
* 1 cup white flour
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 1 tbsp baking powder
* 1 cup sugar (you can also do half white and half brown, but I never have it)
* .25 tsp salt
* 5 tbsp butter, softened
* 1 tsp apple cider vinegar
* 1 cup milk
* 1.5 tsp vanilla extract
* .5 tsp orange extract
* 1 cup dried cranberries, chopped
* 4 ounces of white chocolate, cut into chunks (I used a bar of Lindt)<br/><br/>

"WhItE cHoCoLaTe IsN't ReAlLy ChOcOlAtE," he said, as I unspooled the last of his small intestine from his abdominal cavity.<br/>

## Do this
* Preheat oven to 375 Â°F
* Line or grease a 12-cup muffin tin. Or be smart like I am and use a silicone muffin tray
* Mix apple cider vinegar and milk and set aside
* Using a mixer or whatever, combine butter and and sugar until well mixed
* Add egg, milk, vanilla and orange extract and mix
* Slowly mix in flour, salt, baking soda and cranberries
* Gently fold in white chocolate chunks
* Fill muffin cups until just under the top
* Bake about 20 minutes, until a toothpick in the center of one comes out cleanly <br/>
