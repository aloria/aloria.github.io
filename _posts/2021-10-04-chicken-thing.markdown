For this recipe, you should make the [cherry ginger compote](https://just-the.recipes/2021/10/03/cherry-ginger-compote) ahead of time. <br/><br/>


## What you need:
For the marinade:
* 24 oz chicken broth
* .25 cups apple cider vinegar
* .5 tbsp ginger powder
* 2 tbsp flaxseed oil (or some other kind of oil that is liquid when chilled)<br/><br/>

For the chicken:
* Two 8 oz chicken breasts
* Aluminium foil
* Ginger powder
* Black pepper
* Half a stick of butter
* Oil for high heat, such as avocado or peanut
* Butcher's twine. This has to be 100% cotton or it will melt under high heat.
<br/>
<br/>

## Do This:
The night before:
* Mix the marinade ingredients in a container large enough to hold the chicken breasts
* Add the chicken to the container and shake well. Refrigerate overnight<br/><br/>

The next day:
* Preheat your oven to 400°F
* On a plate, sprinkle black pepper and ginger powder to lightly cover the surface
* Cut butter into thin (about .5 tbsp) slices. Plop onto the ginger/ pepper mixture plate
* Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry
* Cut chicken lengthwise, but not all the way through. Think of Han Solo cutting open a tauntuan.
* Stuff the butter slices into the chicken cavities. Cut them down if they don't fit
* Wrap up each chicken breast in kitchen twine so the butter is safely ensconced inside. You dont want the butter to drip out in the next step
* In a pan, add the oil and sear chicken briefly on both sides on high heat
* Place a sheet of foil on a baking tray and place the chicken on top
* Add any extra butter you have and wrap the chicken up in the foil
* Pop your chicken onto the oven
* Cook for 5 minutes on each side until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F
* Remove twine from chicken
* Plate chicken and top with the cherry compote
* Serve with some sort of side<br/><br/>

This recipe is a bastard child of Chicken Kiev and a recipe called "BUSH’S LEGS AND SOVIET CHICKEN - Chicken over coals with Georgian plum sauce" from [The Soviet Diet Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0892DJT4X/) by Anna Kharzeeva. Apologies, comrades.
