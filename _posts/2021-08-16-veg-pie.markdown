## What you need
* Olive Oil (Extra Virgin)
* Onion Powder
* Garlic Powder
* Sweet Basil Crushed
* Salt
* Ground Pepper<br/><br/>

For the crust:
* 3 medium zucchini, shredded
* 1 cup mozzarella, shredded
* 1 cup pepper jack, shredded
* 2 eggs<br/><br/>

For the topping:
* Pat the zucchini dry and mix with cheese
* Beat the eggs and mix with zucchini/cheese mixture
* Add in about 2 tsp Salt and 1 TBSP pepper and mix well
* Add garlic powder and onion powder to taste (I like about 1 tsp each)
* Cook in oven at 400°F for 10 minutes
* Remove and pat excess moisture off
<br/><br/>

**Note:** You can generally cook everything that goes on top of the zucchini crust while the crust bakes.

## Do this
* Sauté the pepper in ~1 tsp of olive oil (Just enough to barely cover the bottom of a 5 inch pan)
* Cook until tender and starting to brown then set aside in a bowl
* Cook green onion in ~1 tsp of olive oil season with large pinch of onion powder and garlic powder.
* Once the onion starts becoming translucent, add mushroom and cook until they start softening but before they start to sweat.
* Set aside in a bowl.

* In a large pan (~10 inches) put in about 2 tsp of olive oil (enough to cover bottom barely)
* Sautė the Chicken with 2 pinches of garlic powder and 2 pinches of onion powder. Add sweet basil about 1 pinch<br/><br/>

**Note:** You want the chicken to be cooked white on the outside and almost fully cooked inside but not dry and not completely finished.<br/><br/>

* Once the zucchini crust comes out of the oven and has been patted dry, add the peppers, mushroom and onions, then the tomato and chicken.
* Cover with cheese & basil across the top so that it covers all the cheese on top and place in the oven again for 25 minutes at 400°F.<br/><br/>

You can get about 8 small servings or 4 large servings out of this.
