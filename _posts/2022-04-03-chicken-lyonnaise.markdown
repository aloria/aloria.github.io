I wasted to make Chicken Lyonnaise, one if the last dishes served on the Titanic, but I didn't have any demi-glace. I made this instead.<br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* 2 boneless chicken breasts
* 2 tbsp butter
* High heat oil (I used grapeseed)
* 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
* 3/4 cup marsala
* 1 tbsp or more minced garlic
* 1 medium yellow onion, sliced
* 1 shallot, minced
* To taste:
  * Black pepper
  * THE FLAVA ENHANCA (MSG)

## Do this
* On medium-high heat, heat enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of a frying pan
* Cook the chicken on each side for about 4 minutes, until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 Â°F
* Remove chicken and set aside
* Add shallots and onion to pan, cooking for about 3 minutes until onions become translucent
* Add garlic and cook for another minute or so until fragrant
* Reduce heat to medium. Add the wine, vinegar, and butter, and cook until butter is melted
* Add the chicken back in, reduce to medium-low heat, and cook until sauce is reduced to your liking. Add pepper and MSG as it reduces
* Serve chicken topped with the onion-shallot sauce and some sort of side <br/>
