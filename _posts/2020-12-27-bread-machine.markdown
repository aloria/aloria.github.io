So you want to make bread in your bread machine. How original.<br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* A bread machine
* 21.5 oz bread flour (roughly 5 cups but seriously weigh it)
* 1 1/2 cups of water
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil or melted butter
* 2 1/4 tsp salt
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 3 tbsp powdered nonfat dry milk
* 1 1/2 tsp active dry yeast

### Trying to be "Healthy"?
* You can mix white and whole wheat flour to taste, though a 2:1 ratio white to
wheat is as much wheat as I would use.

## Do this
* Dump all the ingredients into the bread machine
* Make sure to keep the salt somewhat separate from the yeast. Salt kills yeast.
* Use the 2.5 lb basic bread setting, medium crust
* If your machine has a mode to beep when you can remove the blades, use it!
* Remove the baked loaf from the machine as soon as possible
* Let cool on a rack for as long as you can stand it, with that fresh baked bread smell permeating your house
