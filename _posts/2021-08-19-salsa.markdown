## What you need:
* 1 29 oz. can crushed tomatoes
* Medium onion, chopped
* 1 or more chopped cloves garlic
* 1 tbsp. crushed red pepper
* 2 tsp. Mexican oregano
* 2 tsp. salt/to taste
* 1 tbsp. ground black pepper
* 4-6 oz. coarsely chopped cilantro
* 1/2-3/4 cup red wine vinegar
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
<br/>
<br/>

## Do This:
* Blend all ingredients until smooth
* Refrigerate for at least 8 hours (seriously it improves so much over time)
<br/>
<br/>

Mexican oregano is a completely different plant from standard oregano so try to get some if you can.
