## What you need
* 1 can spam
* 2 cups short-grain Japanese style rice
* 1 tsp salt
* 4 sheets nori
* optional: 1 tsp sugar, 1-2 tbsp rice vinegar, jelly

## Do this
* Rinse the rice and cook with salt beforehand.  
* Add sugar and vinegar to cooked rice while hot if desired.  Let cool to at least lukewarm.  
* Slice spam into 8 equal slices (parallel to top of can) and saute until lightly browned on each side.  Don’t let it get crispy.  
* Near the end, toss in some jelly (guava is good) and/or soy sauce and cook into the spam.

* Cut the bottom out of the spam can with a can opener.  
* Cut the nori in half, so that each half is about as long as a piece of spam.  
* To assemble, put the can over the middle of a piece of nori, put a slice of spam in, add about 1 inch of rice, pack down, remove can, and tightly wrap nori around, moistening the ends to seal.<br/><br/>

**NOTE:** you can also use a musubi press instead of the can and a wire meat slicer. But usually those are for 10 slices which IMO is too thin and in the other direction, which isn’t optimized for the nori sheets. YMMV.
