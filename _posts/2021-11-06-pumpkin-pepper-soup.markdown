It's soup season*, beyotches! I based this recipe off one I found in a [/r/AITAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/qngem6/aita_for_exposing_and_embarrassing_my_brothers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) post I didn't have sweet potatoes so I basically mutated it into this thing.<br/><br/>

*Any time of the year is soup season.<br/>
## What you need
* One 15 oz can of pumpkin purée
* 1 large red onion, sliced
* 2 red bell peppers, sliced
* 3 tsp Chinese five spice
* 2 tsp hot paprika
* 1 tbsp chili powder
* 1 tbsp garlic powder
* 0.5 tbsp black pepper
* 2.5 cups vegetable or chicken stock (use more or less depending on how thicc you want your soup to be)
* Some sort of cooking oil
* Aluminium foil
* Some sort of blending apparatus <br/>
<br/>

## Do this
* Preheat oven to 400 °F
* Line a baking sheet with foil
* Mix spices with enough oil to cover the vegetables
* Toss vegetables with oil until well coated
* Spread vegetables on the baking sheet and cook until they begin to brown, about 15 minutes
* In a pot, add pumpkin, stock, and vegetables. Bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes
* Let cool before blending it to your desired texture
* I recommend eating this with some crusty bread.<br/>
