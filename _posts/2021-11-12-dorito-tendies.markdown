Why do I do these things? Because I can.<br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* Boneless chicken breasts (whole or strips)
* A ziplock bag
* Aluminium foil
* Flour of some kind (I used rice flour)
* 2 eggs
* To taste:
  * Black pepper
  * Chili powder
  * Garlic powder
  * Onion powder
* Doritos (I prefer Spicy Nacho flavor)
* Oil with a [high smoke point](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/best-oils-frying/) (I used peanut oil)

## Do this
* Preheat oven to 350°F
* Trim fat from chicken and cut into strips if using whole breasts
* Line baking pan with foil and arrange chicken strips so they don't touch
* Bake for ~15 minutes
* While chicken is cooling:
  * Mix enough flour and spices for your volume of chicken in a bowl
  * Whip eggs and a splash of cold water in another bowl
  * Pulverize Doritos in the ziplock bag and transfer to another bowl
* Once chicken is cool enough to handle, dip each piece in the flour mixture
* Dip each floured piece in the eggs, or apply using a basting brush
* Dip into Dorito crumbs
* Heat oil on medium high heat
* Cook strips on each side for ~2-3 minutes. Because they were pre-baked, it won't take as long as if they were raw
* Put some paper towels on a dish and place tendies on top to absorb the excess oil
* Enjoy with your choice of dipping sauce. Might I recommend my [Jalapeño Garlic Honey Sauce](https://just-the.recipes/2021/11/07/jalapeno-honey)? <br/>
