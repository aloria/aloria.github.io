## What you need:
* A blender or food processor
* 2 cups diced carrots
* .5 cups diced yellow onion
* 3 tbsp chopped ginger
* 3/4 cups rice vinegar
* 10 tbsp rice vinegar (I guess you can use apple cider in a pinch)
* .5 tbsp sesame oil
* A pinch ground black pepper
* (optional) .25 tsp chili paste
* 3/4 cups oil. I use peanut or avocado oil.
<br/>
<br/>

## Do This:
* Blend everything except the oil until smooth
* Gradually add the oil until well blended
* Add more ginger or pepper to taste <br/><br/>

Serve over salad. Or chug it if you're not a coward.
