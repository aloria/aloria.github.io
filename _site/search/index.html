        "categories": "[&quot;meats&quot;]",
        "content": "Learned it from my late (100 % Hungarian) grandma.You don’t want my life story. But you do want to know which kind of meat to use, right? Bear with me.Gulyásleves is actually more of a soup than a stew. The stew itself is called pörkölt and must consist of beef, onions, paprika, grease, and seasonings and maybe a tomato or two.The meat for a proper pörkölt is often cheap beef stew meat, the kind you simmer for hours and hours until it becomes nearly chewable. Not grandma. She always used „Nuß“, a part of the “head of the quadriceps” muscle, musculus rectus femoris. It’s labelled „Zapfen“ in the image; just print the pretty picture and tell your butcher you want the part ringed in red. This is what the simmer time of 1.5 hours is calculated for.What you needFor four really hungry people or eight normal eaters; more if you serve sides:  1 kg (2.2 lbs.) beef, cubed to 15 mm (½”–¾”) a side.Use good stew meat, see above.Before cubing, strip the silvery-white sheath if present.  1 kg white or yellow onions (same quantity as beef)  1 large tomato;or 2 medium ones;or canned tomatoes or tomato paste (gross!)  8 Tbsp paprika powder (sweet, and more helps more)  1.5 tsp paprika powder (spicy hot)  abt. 150–200 g (5–7 oz.) pork lard (traditional);or clarified butter;or peanut or canola oils (meh) with a pat of butter for taste  Salt  WaterPreparation is easy. Try not to fuck it up:  Chop the onions.  In a large sauce pan, heat the fat and add the onions.  Stir on medium heat until the onions are transparent. Brown onions are bitter; discard and start over.  Extinguish with 2 or 3 Tbsp water.  Add both paprika powders and allow the mixture to come to a boil  Extinguish with another 2–3 Tbsp water.  Remove and reserve most of the onions so that the beef can braise well.  Add the cubed beef and heat while stirring until the pores of the meat close; the surface will be grey-ish.  Add the reserved onions back in when the meat is braised.  Add the peeled and diced tomatoes and a good dose of salt.  Add water until the meat is covered. If you need more than a pint or so per lb. of meat, use a smaller pot and reduce the sauce after cooking.  Allow to simmer for 1.5 hours, stirring very occasionally. The result should be a watery sauce with delicious, tender meat cubes and discernible onion pieces.  Season to taste with more salt. If you want it spicier, add hot paprika; note that Hungarian cuisine is not fiery-hot.The above is what is known in Vienna as „Saftgulasch“ (“sauce-goulash”). Its distinguishing characteristic is that the sauce is bound only by the gelatin extracted from the meat during cooking, by the onion solids, and by reducing the stew to the desired consistency.Traditionally, this dish is served with only dark rye bread on the side, but white bread will work, too, or rice, or Hungarian Tarhonya.Variations on a common themeRindsgulasch, beef goulash. Do not braise the beef in the onions. Instead, while the onions are cooking, cover the meat cubes in flour and sauté them in a separate pan. Then, add them to the onions and continue.Zigeunergulasch, gypsy goulash. Like Rindsgulasch in that the meat is floured and pan-browned. Uses beef, lamb, or pork, or any mix of these. Later in the cooking, add diced potatoes, diced green bell peppers, and diced tomato (in addition to the tomato you already used).Esterházygulasch. Named after the blue-blood Esterházy family. Prepare a Rindsgulasch, bind with sour cream, add a julienne of yellow beets, carrots, and celery root; refine with more sour cream, and serve with Salzkartoffeln (salt potatoes: put raw peeled potatoes in heavily salted cold water, bring to boil, simmer for ~20 minutes until done, pour off water, let stand for two minutes, add chopped dill or chopped flat parsley if desired).Karlsbader Gulasch. So named after the spa resort for the rich in the old Austrian monarchy. Prepare a basic goulash; stir some flour into cold water (no clumping, please!), add sour cream generously, stir into the goulash. Serve with Nockerln (Italian potato gnocchi will do in a pinch).Kaisergulasch, Emperor goulash. Use beef tenderloin and adjust cooking time. Serve with “lard-noodles” („abgeschmalzene Nudeln“): cook egg noodles, like German-style „Spätzle“ or what you find at the Asian grocery, until soft. Meanwhile, finely chop an onion and fry it in lard until transparent, then continue frying until it is yellow. Pour over the pasta and serve. Alternative: instead of lard, render diced bacon and use that to fry the chopped onion. Yum!Bauerngulasch, peasant’s goulash. Rindsgulasch as above, garnished with small Semmelknödel (I have a recipe for that, too).Fiakergulasch, coachman’s goulash, Herrengulasch, gentleman’s goulash. Rindsgulasch garnished with a pan-fried egg (traditionally sunny side up), a pan-fried Frankfurter or two, a partially sliced and spread into fan-shape gherkin (cornichon may be substituted). Optional: A couple of slices of Semmelknödel, maybe even pan-fried; otherwise white bread.",

Once the onion starts becoming translucent, add mushroom and cook until they start softening but before they start to sweat.      Set aside in a bowl.    In a large pan (~10 inches) put in about 2 tsp of olive oil (enough to cover bottom barely)  Sautė the Chicken with 2 pinches of garlic powder and 2 pinches of onion powder. Add sweet basil about 1 pinchNote: You want the chicken to be cooked white on the outside and almost fully cooked inside but not dry and not completely finished.  Once the zucchini crust comes out of the oven and has been patted dry, add the peppers, mushroom and onions, then the tomato and chicken.  Cover with cheese &amp; basil across the top so that it covers all the cheese on top and place in the oven again for 25 minutes at 400°F.You can get about 8 small servings or 4 large servings out of this.",

Add sugar and vinegar to cooked rice while hot if desired.  Let cool to at least lukewarm.  Slice spam into 8 equal slices (parallel to top of can) and saute until lightly browned on each side.  Don’t let it get crispy.      Near the end, toss in some jelly (guava is good) and/or soy sauce and cook into the spam.    Cut the bottom out of the spam can with a can opener.  Cut the nori in half, so that each half is about as long as a piece of spam.  To assemble, put the can over the middle of a piece of nori, put a slice of spam in, add about 1 inch of rice, pack down, remove can, and tightly wrap nori around, moistening the ends to seal.NOTE: you can also use a musubi press instead of the can and a wire meat slicer.

Some vegetable oil      Garlic powder      A pan to fry up the beef      A spatula      A couple of spoons      A can of cream of mushroom soup      (optional) small jar of petit pois and baby carrots      Do this  Prep pasta          Put the pasta in the pot with a pinch of salt.      Fill the pot with enough water to cover the pasta plus like a half inch      Put this on the back stove burner and turn it on. You’re going to want to watch this boil while you do the other stuff.      After it starts boiling, poke it with a fork every minute or so to see if you can stab a noodle - if you can do that, drain off any water using the strainer.      or  Prep pasta the lazy way          Chuck it into a rice cooker and even it out      Add water so the pasta is barely covered      Stir through a pinch of salt and some vegetable oil      Close it up and turn the fucker on and forget about it        Meanwhile:          Put a spoonful of vegetable oil in the pan, then put the ground beef on top of that.      Get a spoonful or two of garlic powder and toss it on the beef.      Turn the heat on medium and watch this cook.      Every 30 seconds or so, chop up the beef in the pan and stir it around. You want everything to be in small bits that are brown and hot.      If you get a bunch of fat, scoot the beef to one side and tip the pan a little the other way so you can get it out with a spoon.        When the beef is browned:          Dump the can of cream of mushroom soup over the beef. Stir it around until everything is hot.      Put some noodles in a bowl      Put some beef stuff on top      Maybe add some salt and pepper, or sprinkle on some tarragon if you have it. I’m not your mom.        Other things you can do:          Try having this on rice. It’s good.      Add some spices other than garlic - try chipotle powder or summat.      Throw in some peas when you add the mushroom soup. Or chopped up carrots. Or both. Or be lazy and use a jar of the stuff.      Try it with ground chicken or turkey or pork. Use e.g. quorn mince if you’re vegetarian.      Throw in some spinach with the beef when it’s almost done browning. Or chopped mushrooms. Let those cook down with it.      ",
