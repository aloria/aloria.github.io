# Hi

## About
Just the F\*cking Recipe is a recipe blog run by [aloria](https://twitter.com/aloria) because quarantine is boring and one can only crochet so much.

## Submissions
Please be forwarned that I reserve the right to call out any shenanigans. Don't ruin this for everyone by being a buttwaffle.  
<br/>
Make sure to include your (social media | website | picture of your cat) with your submission so I can make sure you get appropriate credit.

### Option 1: Pull request
If you're comfortable with Git, you can [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). Recipe posts are in [aloria.github.io/_posts](https://github.com/aloria/aloria.github.io/tree/main/_posts), which you can use as a starting template. Posts use [Jekyll Markdown](https://gist.github.com/roachhd/779fa77e9b90fe945b0c).

### Option 2: Twitter DM
You can also submit by sending a Direct Message to JTFR's twitter account [@TheFckingRecipe](https://twitter.com/TheFckingRecipe).

### Option 3: Email
I can't believe I'm doing this. You can also send recipes to [farts@just-the.recipe](mailto:farts@just-the.recipe). Be nice.
